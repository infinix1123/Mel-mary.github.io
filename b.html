          <h1>Taylor Alison Swift</h1>
        <p class="card-text">born December 13, 1989 is an American singer-songwriter. She is a prominent cultural figure, widely recognized for her genre-spanning discography, songwriting and artistic reinventions. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist, signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004, and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled album made her the first female country artist to write a U.S. platinum-certified debut album.

Her next two albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" were the first country songs to top the U.S. pop and all-genre airplay charts, respectively. She experimented with rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which featured her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", and eschewed her country image in her synth-pop album 1989 (2014), supported by chart-topping songs "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny inspired her next album Reputation (2017) and its number-one single "Look What You Made Me Do".</p>
